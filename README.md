# Aviator APP
This is a Python script for collecting Aviator odds.
## Context

Betika and sportpesa and maybe other platforms have aviator betting option.
I would like to read paterns if any by collecting ~1000 cycles of odds and store for future analysis.

## Platform

*This tool is specific for betika aviator, implementation for other providers like sportpesa will come
later on after this one is up and running*

## Implementation

Right now it stores odd and the date plus time the odd was stored in a csv file.
This should be able to help me determine any pattern that can be used to predict a safe bet in aviator
